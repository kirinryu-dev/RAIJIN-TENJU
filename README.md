# RAIJIN TENJU ⚡

**A cyber inspired task system and user ritual experiment.**

Welcome to **RAIJIN TENJU 🛕**

---

## 🌀 What is Raijin Tenju?

Inspired by the *Inter-Knot* system from games like **Zenless Zone Zero**, **RAIJIN TENJU** is a creative task management experiment where users, known as **Knotwalkers**, engage with digital contracts, bindings, and rituals to enhance focus and accountability.

Rather than being a game, Raijin Tenju is a productivity space wrapped in a cyberpunk mythology — where **trust is earned**, and access is unlocked through interaction.

``Knotwalkers`` are not just task-doers. They're explorers of the digital flow, maintaining their mission log while keeping their system secure.

> No storylines. No fan fiction. Just systems.

## 🔒 Key Concepts

- **Knotwalker**: The user's role, navigating through digital tasks.
- **Untrusted Users**: Newly registered. Can manage up to **10 tasks**.
- **ICE Binding Ritual**: A custom second-layer auth to unlock full access.
- **Trusted Users**: Users who completed the ICE Binding Ritual gain extended task limits.
- **Task System**: JSON + MySQL hybrid task tracker with visual and minimal UI.
- **Cyberpunk Interface**: Custom-built buttons, icons, and logic — no frameworks used.
